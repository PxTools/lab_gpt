```

   - [Instructions V0](./instructions/instructions_v0.txt)
   - [Instructions V2](./instructions/instructions_v2.txt)
2. **Knowledge:** Download and upload the knowledge files listed below.

   - [Action (V2)](./actions/swagger_v2.json) - Add if using V2 instructions

### GPT Usage

You can now use your own SSB Assistant GPT!

- You can use the GPT in preview mode (available while editing the GPT). This will display all the requests and responses the GPT gets while interacting with the Actions/API Docs you added. This is a nice way to debug and understand where the GPT makes mistakes.
- You can also use your GPT in your ChatGPT interface if you save the GPT for "only me", "people with link" or "public".
