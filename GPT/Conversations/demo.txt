Hey, can you find economic trends for housing prices?


Let's take a closer look at Table 12880? I want 


Can you find housing prices for 2023 to 2026?


Can you create line graphs of this data? Use 0 as the origo?


I now want you to find the price index for existing dwellings. Do you have data for this?


Table 07230 fits my purpose. What kinds of parameters does this data have?


Can you fetch data for the whole country, from 2015 to 2022, covering all types of buildings, and of course the Price Index?


Great! Can you now merge this data with the forecast into one graph? I want the actual data to have a different color than the forecast, so I can see the difference.


This graph looks nice. Can you add a new dotted line that connects 2022 and 2023?
