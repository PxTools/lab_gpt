## ssb vs hagstova
An appempt to compare data from Faroe Isloands and Norway.
The idea is to find one table from each contry and compare. 
The problem is that, at least in v0 , there is not enough information in the response from getTables to make the call on which tables is compareable.
So you would need to get more metadata. As size and stability is an issue, we stopped here.
The good news is that getting data from hagstova is possible.
