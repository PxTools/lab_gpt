# Some experiments
In these folders files for more experimental usage is stored. If you havent set up an GTP, I suggest you follow the setup guide once, just to see what goes where. 

## CSV extraction.
To mittigate size problems. Creates a python script that produces a csv when run by user.
   

## ssb vs hagstova
An appempt to compare data from Faroe Isloands and Norway.
The idea is to find one table from each contry and compare. 
The problem is that, at least in v0 , there is not enough information in the response from getTables to make the call on which tables is compareable.
So you would need to get more metadata. As size and stability is an issue, we stopped here.
The good news is that getting data from hagstova is possible.  


## Get sample data
Uses the getData endpoint(v2) without any query, which returns a small data sample.
